Data location:
When you use a reference type, you must explicitly provide the data storage location for the type. The following options can be used to specify the data location where the type is stored:

memory:
* The location where function arguments are stored
* Has a lifetime limited to the lifetime of an external function call
storage:
* The location where state variables are stored
* Has a lifetime limited to the contract lifetime
calldata:
* The location where function arguments are stored
* This location is required for parameters of external functions, but can also be used for other variables
* Has a lifetime limited to the lifetime of an external function call


What is a smart contract?

* A smart contract is a program that's stored inside a blockchain. Smart contracts extend blockchain from data to code. They represent an agreement between parties. The agreement is coded, and when an action happens, the code runs and provides a response.

* All of the terms and conditions of the contracts are programmatically defined. A definition specifies the rules, requirements, and rewards for the participants in the blockchain. It also specifies how digital assets are transferred between parties. Each smart contract is assigned a 20-byte address that uniquely identifies it.

* Smart contracts run on their own, send events that trigger state transitions, and call functions. They're perfect for blockchain technology because they allow people who don't know one another to do business in a securely specified way that requires no middleman.

* Smart contracts are most commonly used with Ethereum. Ethereum is the world's first programmable blockchain. It allows smart contracts to be defined to help facilitate the transfer of digital assets, like ether.

* The language you'll use to write contracts is Solidity. Solidity is Turing-complete, which means that you can write complicated contracts in a clearly defined and coded way.

* Because every state transition is logged and immutable, you should thoroughly test the contract before you release it into a production environment. Bug fixes can be costly and can even cause critical system damage.

Smart contracts have these key properties and advantages:

* Transparency: Blockchain users can read smart contracts and can access them by using APIs.

* Immutability: Smart contract execution creates logs that can't be changed.

* Distribution: The output of the contract is validated and verified by nodes on the network. Contract states can be publicly visible. In some cases, even "private" variables are visible.

Use cases:

* Smart contracts can benefit many industries and processes. Consider the following use cases.

* Insurance: When certain events occur, smart contracts automatically trigger a claim that simplifies and streamlines the claims process. Then, to determine the amount of compensation that users receive, claim details can be recorded on the blockchain. This functionality can reduce processing times and human errors.

* Voting: Smart contracts can help make voting automatic and transparent. Each contract serves as one ballot, which represents a voter's identity. Because a blockchain is immutable, meaning that it can't be changed, votes can't be tampered with.

* Supply chains: As items move through the supply chain, smart contracts can record ownership and can confirm who's responsible for a product at any given time. At any stage, the smart contract can be used to find out exactly where the products should be. If any party in the supply chain fails to deliver on time, then every other party knows where the problem happened.

* Record keeping: Many industries can use smart contracts to improve the speed and security of record keeping. Blockchain technology can be used to digitize records and to securely encrypt and store them. Plus, access can be gated so that only allowed individuals can access the records.

* Property ownership: Smart contracts can record who owns property. They're a fast and cost-efficient way to record ownership. Smart contracts can also help facilitate the transfer of ownership in a timely and secure way.

Token standards are defined in the Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs). Although new standards are continuously being proposed and accepted, standards for four primary ERC types have been widely adopted:

ERC20
ERC721
ERC777
ERC1155
Let's explore each type of token. We'll take a moment to understand what makes each one significant and unique.

ERC20:
* The ERC20 token is the most widely known and used. ERC20 is the technical standard that's used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to implement tokens. ERC20 has a simple interface for basic tokens.

You can keep track of fungible tokens by using ERC20 token contracts. Any one ERC20 token is equal to any other token. Also, ERC20 tokens don't have any associated special rights or behaviors, which make the tokens useful for things like staking, currency exchange, and voting rights.

ERC721
* ERC721 is the top solution for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Like all other tokens, NFTs represent ownership both of virtual and physical assets. These assets are likely to include:

* Collectible items, like antiques, cards, or art
* Physical assets, like houses or cars
* Negative-value assets, like loans
* Each token is unique and has ownership and status that must be tracked.

While similar, the ERC721 token and ERC20 token differ in complexity. The ERC721 token is more complex. Also, with the ERC721 token, each function has an argument to specify the token ID that uniquely identifies the token being used in the smart contract.

ERC777:
* ERC777 is a richer standard that is used for fungible tokens. The standard can be used for new use cases and to build on learnings from previous token standards. It's backward-compatible with ERC20, which means you can interact with ERC777 tokens as if they're ERC20 tokens. You can use ERC777 tokens for interactions that are more complex trades.

ERC1155: 
* ERC1155 is a standard that's used to manage multiple types of tokens. A contract can represent multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens.

* ERC1155 draws on ideas from ERC20, ERC721, and ERC777.

* The design of the ERC1155 token type allows for massive gas savings, for a couple reasons. (In Ethereum, gas refers to a fee or pricing value charged to execute transactions.) First, you can use this token contract for multiple tokens, which means fewer deployments with less complexity. It also has batched operations, so a single function call can be simpler and less gas-intensive.
